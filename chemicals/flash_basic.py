def K_value(P=None, Psat=None, phi_l=None, phi_g=None, gamma=None, Poynting=1.0):
    r'''Calculates the equilibrium K-value assuming Raoult's law,
    or an equation of state model, or an activity coefficient model,
    or a combined equation of state-activity model.

    The calculation procedure will use the most advanced approach with the
    provided inputs:

        * If `P`, `Psat`, `phi_l`, `phi_g`, and `gamma` are provided, use the
          combined approach.
        * If `P`, `Psat`, and `gamma` are provided, use the modified Raoult's
          law.
        * If `phi_l` and `phi_g` are provided, use the EOS only method.
        * If `P` and `Psat` are provided, use Raoult's law.

    Definitions:

    .. math::
        K_i=\frac{y_i}{x_i}

    Raoult's law:

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{P_{i}^{sat}}{P}

    Activity coefficient, no EOS (modified Raoult's law):

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_{i}^{sat}}{P}

    Equation of state only:

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\phi_i^l}{\phi_i^v} = \frac{f_i^l y_i}{f_i^v x_i}

    Combined approach (liquid reference fugacity coefficient is normally
    calculated the saturation pressure for it as a pure species; vapor fugacity
    coefficient calculated normally):

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_i^{sat} \phi_i^{l,ref}}{\phi_i^v P}

    Combined approach, with Poynting Correction Factor (liquid molar volume in
    the integral is for i as a pure species only):

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_i^{sat} \phi_i^{l, ref} \exp\left[\frac{
        \int_{P_i^{sat}}^P V_i^l dP}{RT}\right]}{\phi_i^v P}

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : float
        System pressure, optional
    Psat : float
        Vapor pressure of species i, [Pa]
    phi_l : float
        Fugacity coefficient of species i in the liquid phase, either
        at the system conditions (EOS-only case) or at the saturation pressure
        of species i as a pure species (reference condition for the combined
        approach), optional [-]
    phi_g : float
        Fugacity coefficient of species i in the vapor phase at the system
        conditions, optional [-]
    gamma : float
        Activity coefficient of species i in the liquid phase, optional [-]
    Poynting : float
        Poynting correction factor, optional [-]

    Returns
    -------
    K : float
        Equilibrium K value of component i, calculated with an approach
        depending on the provided inputs [-]

    Notes
    -----
    The Poynting correction factor is normally simplified as follows, due to
    a liquid's low pressure dependency:

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_i^{sat} \phi_i^{l, ref} \exp\left[\frac{V_l
        (P-P_i^{sat})}{RT}\right]}{\phi_i^v P}

    Examples
    --------
    Raoult's law:

    >>> K_value(101325, 3000.)
    0.029607698001480384

    Modified Raoult's law:

    >>> K_value(P=101325, Psat=3000, gamma=0.9)
    0.026646928201332347

    EOS-only approach:

    >>> K_value(phi_l=1.6356, phi_g=0.88427)
    1.8496613025433408

    Gamma-phi combined approach:

    >>> K_value(P=1E6, Psat=1938800, phi_l=1.4356, phi_g=0.88427, gamma=0.92)
    2.8958055544121137

    Gamma-phi combined approach with a Poynting factor:

    >>> K_value(P=1E6, Psat=1938800, phi_l=1.4356, phi_g=0.88427, gamma=0.92,

def Wilson_K_value(T, P, Tc, Pc, omega):
    r'''Calculates the equilibrium K-value for a component using Wilson's
    heuristic mode. This is very useful for initialization of stability tests
    and flashes.

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{P_c}{P} \exp\left(5.37(1+\omega)\left[1 - \frac{T_c}{T}
        \right]\right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : float
        System temperature, [K]
    P : float
        System pressure, [Pa]
    Tc : float
        Critical temperature of fluid [K]
    Pc : float
        Critical pressure of fluid [Pa]
    omega : float
        Acentric factor for fluid, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    K : float
        Equilibrium K value of component, calculated via the Wilson heuristic
        [-]

    Notes
    -----
    There has been little literature exploration of other formlulas for the
    same purpose. This model may be useful even for activity coefficient
    models.

    Note the K-values are independent of composition; the correlation is
    applicable up to 3.5 MPa.

    A description for how this function was generated can be found in [2]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Ethane at 270 K and 76 bar:

    >>> Wilson_K_value(270.0, 7600000.0, 305.4, 4880000.0, 0.098)
    0.2963932297479371

    The "vapor pressure" predicted by this equation can be calculated by
    multiplying by pressure:

    >>> Wilson_K_value(270.0, 7600000.0, 305.4, 4880000.0, 0.098)*7600000.0

def flash_wilson(zs, Tcs, Pcs, omegas, T=None, P=None, VF=None):
    r'''PVT flash model using Wilson's equation - useful for obtaining initial
    guesses for more rigorous models, or it can be used as its own model.
    Capable of solving with two of `T`, `P`, and `VF` for the other one;
    that results in three solve modes, but for `VF=1` and `VF=0`, there are
    additional solvers; for a total of seven solvers implemented.

    This model uses `flash_inner_loop` to solve the Rachford-Rice problem.

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{P_c}{P} \exp\left(5.37(1+\omega)\left[1 - \frac{T_c}{T}
        \right]\right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    zs : list[float]
        Mole fractions of the phase being flashed, [-]
    Tcs : list[float]
        Critical temperatures of all species, [K]
    Pcs : list[float]
        Critical pressures of all species, [Pa]
    omegas : list[float]
        Acentric factors of all species, [-]
    T : float, optional
        Temperature, [K]
    P : float, optional
        Pressure, [Pa]
    VF : float, optional
        Molar vapor fraction, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    T : float
        Temperature, [K]
    P : float
        Pressure, [Pa]
    VF : float
        Molar vapor fraction, [-]
    xs : list[float]
        Mole fractions of liquid phase, [-]
    ys : list[float]
        Mole fractions of vapor phase, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    For the cases where `VF` is 1 or 0 and T is known, an explicit solution is
    used. For the same cases where `P` and `VF` are known, there is no explicit
    solution available.

    There is an internal `Tmax` parameter, set to 50000 K; which, in the event
    of convergence of the Secant method, is used as a bounded for a bounded
    solver. It is used in the PVF solvers. This typically allows pressures
    up to 2 GPa to be converged to. However, for narrow-boiling mixtures, the
    PVF failure may occur at much lower pressures.

def flash_Tb_Tc_Pc(zs, Tbs, Tcs, Pcs, T=None, P=None, VF=None):
    r'''PVT flash model using a model published in [1]_, which provides a PT
    surface using only each compound's boiling temperature and critical
    temperature and pressure. This is useful for obtaining initial
    guesses for more rigorous models, or it can be used as its own model.
    Capable of solving with two of `T`, `P`, and `VF` for the other one;
    that results in three solve modes, but for `VF=1` and `VF=0`, there are
    additional solvers; for a total of seven solvers implemented.

    This model uses `flash_inner_loop` to solve the Rachford-Rice problem.

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{P_{c,i}^{\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{b,i}} \right) /
        \left(\frac{1}{T_{c,i}} - \frac{1}{T_{b,i}} \right)}}{P}

    Parameters
    ----------
    zs : list[float]
        Mole fractions of the phase being flashed, [-]
    Tbs : list[float]
        Boiling temperatures of all species, [K]
    Tcs : list[float]
        Critical temperatures of all species, [K]
    Pcs : list[float]
        Critical pressures of all species, [Pa]
    T : float, optional
        Temperature, [K]
    P : float, optional
        Pressure, [Pa]
    VF : float, optional
        Molar vapor fraction, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    T : float
        Temperature, [K]
    P : float
        Pressure, [Pa]
    VF : float
        Molar vapor fraction, [-]
    xs : list[float]
        Mole fractions of liquid phase, [-]
    ys : list[float]
        Mole fractions of vapor phase, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    For the cases where `VF` is 1 or 0 and T is known, an explicit solution is
    used. For the same cases where `P` and `VF` are known, there is no explicit
    solution available.

    There is an internal `Tmax` parameter, set to 50000 K; which, in the event
    of convergence of the Secant method, is used as a bounded for a bounded
    solver. It is used in the PVF solvers. This typically allows pressures
    up to 2 MPa to be converged to. Failures may still occur for other
    conditions.

    This model is based on [1]_, which aims to estimate dew and bubble points
    using the same K value formulation as used here. While this implementation
    uses a numerical solver to provide an exact bubble/dew point estimate,
    [1]_ suggests a sequential substitution and flowchart based solver with
    loose tolerances. That model was also implemented, but found to be slower
    and less reliable than this implementation.

def flash_ideal(zs, funcs, Tcs=None, T=None, P=None, VF=None):
    r'''PVT flash model using ideal, composition-independent equation.
    Solves the various cases of composition-independent models.

    Capable of solving with two of `T`, `P`, and `VF` for the other one;
    that results in three solve modes, but for `VF=1` and `VF=0`, there are
    additional solvers; for a total of seven solvers implemented.

    The function takes a list of callables that take `T` in Kelvin as an argument,
    and return vapor pressure. The callables can include the effect of
    non-ideal pure component fugacity coefficients. For the (`T`, `P`) and
    (`P`, `VF`) cases, the Poynting correction factor can be easily included as
    well but not the (`T`, `VF`) case as the callable only takes `T` as an
    argument. Normally the Poynting correction factor is used with activity
    coefficient models with composition dependence.

    Both `flash_wilson` and `flash_Tb_Tc_Pc` are specialized cases of this
    function and have the same functionality but with the model built right in.

    Even when using more complicated models, this is useful for obtaining initial

    This model uses `flash_inner_loop` to solve the Rachford-Rice problem.

        in Kelvin and return pressure in Pa, [-]
    Tcs : list[float], optional
        Critical temperatures of all species; uses as upper bounds and only
        for the case that `T` is not specified; if they are needed and not
        given, it is assumed a method `solve_prop` exists in each of `funcs`
        which will accept `P` in Pa and return temperature in `K`, [K]
    T : float, optional
        Temperature, [K]
    P : float, optional
        Pressure, [Pa]
    VF : float, optional

    VF : float
        Molar vapor fraction, [-]

    Examples
    --------
    Basic case with four compounds, usingthe Antoine equation as a model and
    solving for vapor pressure:

    >>> from chemicals import Antoine, Ambrose_Walton
    >>> Tcs = [369.83, 425.12, 469.7, 507.6]
    >>> Antoine_As = [8.92828, 8.93266, 8.97786, 9.00139]

    >>> round(VF, 10)
    1.00817e-05

    Similar case, using the Ambrose-Walton corresponding states method to estimate
    vapor pressures:

    >>> Tcs = [369.83, 425.12, 469.7, 507.6]
    >>> Pcs = [4248000.0, 3796000.0, 3370000.0, 3025000.0]

    >>> for i in range(4):
    ...     def Psat_func(T, Tc=Tcs[i], Pc=Pcs[i], omega=omegas[i]):

    >>> round(P, 3)
    1000013.343

    Case with fugacities in the liquid phase, vapor phase, activity coefficients
    in the liquid phase, and Poynting correction factors.

    >>> Tcs = [647.14, 514.0]
    >>> Antoine_As = [10.1156, 10.3368]
    >>> Antoine_Bs = [1687.54, 1648.22]
    >>> Antoine_Cs = [-42.98, -42.232]
    >>> gammas = [1.1, .75]
    >>> fugacities_gas = [.995, 0.98]
    >>> fugacities_liq = [.9999, .9998]
    >>> Poyntings = [1.000001, .999999]
    >>> zs = [.5, .5]
    >>> funcs = []
    >>> for i in range(2):

    ...                  fg=fugacities_gas[i], gamma=gammas[i], poy=Poyntings[i]):
    ...         return Antoine(T, A, B, C)*gamma*poy*fl/fg
    ...     funcs.append(K_over_P)
    >>> _, _, VF, xs, ys = flash_ideal(zs, funcs, Tcs=Tcs, P=1e5, T=364.0)
    >>> VF, xs, ys

    Note that while this works for PT composition independent flashes - an
    outer iterating loop is needed for composition dependence!
